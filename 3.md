# Cloudflare Infrastructure & Global Network

An overview of the massive global infrastructure that powers Cloudflare's speed, security, and reliability.

## Global Network Scale

*   **Reach**: Spanning over **330+ cities** in more than **125 countries**, Cloudflare's network is one of the largest on Earth.
*   **Proximity**: Approximately **95% of the global internet-connected population** lives within 50 milliseconds of a Cloudflare data center.
*   **Capacity**: Engineered to handle immense scale, processing millions of requests per second with massive interconnection capacity.

## Anycast Architecture

Cloudflare utilizes **Anycast** routing, a core technology that differentiates it from traditional CDNs.

*   **Single IP Address**: Instead of specific servers having unique IPs, multiple servers across the globe share the same IP address.
*   **Lowest Latency**: Requests are automatically routed to the "topologically nearest" data center, ensuring the fastest possible response time.
*   **Resilience**: If one data center goes offline, traffic is instantly rerouted to the next closest location, providing inherent failover and high availability.
*   **DDoS Protection**: Attack traffic is distributed across the entire global network, absorbing and mitigating large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks at the edge.

## Edge Computing & AI

The network requires moving computation away from centralized origins to the network "edge"—closer to the user.

*   **Workers Platform**: Functions run in data centers close to the user, reducing latency for dynamic applications.
*   **AI Inference**: 2024-2025 has seen a massive expansion in AI capabilities, with GPUs deployed globally to run inference tasks (Workers AI) directly at the edge.
*   **IoT Support**: With the explosion of IoT devices, the edge network processes data locally, minimizing the need for round-trips to central servers.

## 2024-2025 Evolution

*   **Traffic Growth**: Handling a steady 17-19% year-over-year increase in global internet traffic.
*   **GenAI Focus**: A 251% yearly growth in traffic to GenAI services in 2025, supported by specialized edge infrastructure.
*   **Post-Quantum Security**: Implementation of post-quantum encryption standards across the internal and external network.
