# Cloudflare Infrastructure & Global Network

A deep dive into the massive global infrastructure that powers Cloudflare's speed, security, and world-class reliability.

## Global Network Scale

*   **Massive Reach**: Spanning over **330+ cities** across **125+ countries**, ensuring content is always close to the user.
*   **Proximity**: Approximately **95% of the world's internet population** is within 50ms of a Cloudflare data center.
*   **Capacity**: Engineered to handle tens of millions of requests per second, absorbing the largest DDoS attacks in history.

## Anycast & Routing

*   **Anycast Architecture**: Multiple servers globally share the same IP address, automatically routing users to the topologically nearest point.
*   **Zero-Latency Resilience**: Traffic is instantly rerouted if a data center goes offline, providing inherent high availability.
*   **Post-Quantum Security**: Cloudflare is a leader in implementing post-quantum encryption standards to future-proof global data.

## Edge Computing Evolution

*   **The Edge is the Computer**: Moving beyond simple caching to running full application logic at the edge via the **Workers Platform**.
*   **Global GPU Deployment**: Massive rollout of GPUs across the network enables **Workers AI** for lightning-fast inference.
*   **IoT & Local Processing**: Minimizing latency by processing device data locally at the edge rather than round-tripping to central clouds.
