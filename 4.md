# Trending Cloudflare Infrastructure & Prototypes (Social Media Hot)

A curated list of Cloudflare open-source projects and prototypes that are currently buzzing on social media (Twitter/X, GitHub, Hacker News).

## 🔥 Social Media Prototypes & Demos

These are "experimental" or "hacky" projects that gained viral attention for showing what's possible.

*   **[Llama-3-Workers-AI](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-ai)**: Official demos of running Llama 3 on Workers AI that went viral for their speed and zero-cold-start capabilities.
*   **[Multiplayer Doom](https://github.com/cloudflare/doom-workers)**: A port of Doom to WebAssembly running on Workers, using Durable Objects for multiplayer state. A classic "can it run Doom?" proof of concept.
*   **[Wildebeest](https://github.com/cloudflare/wildebeest)**: An ActivityPub and Mastodon-compatible server built on Workers. Gained massive traction during the Twitter migration wave.
*   **[Chat-with-PDF](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/main/examples/src/use_cases/chat_with_pdf)**: Various implementations of "Chat with your Data" using Vectorize (Cloudflare's Vector DB) and Workers AI, frequently shared in AI engineering circles.

## 🏗️ Trending Infrastructure (The "New Stack")

Core infrastructure components that are reshaping how developers build on Cloudflare.

*   **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: Now part of the Cloudflare family, Astro is the "hot" framework for content-driven sites, perfectly optimized for Pages and Edge caching.
*   **[PartyKit](https://github.com/partykit/partykit)**: A platform designed specifically for building real-time, multiplayer apps with Durable Objects. Extremely popular in the "Local-first" and "Collaboration" dev communities.
*   **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/model-context-protocol)**: The open standard connecting AI agents to data. Cloudflare's support and demos for MCP have been a major topic in 2025 dev tools discussions.
*   **[pg_driver for D1](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk)**: Community and official efforts to make standard Postgres drivers work seamlessly with D1, unlocking the huge ecosystem of ORMs (Prisma, Drizzle) for edge databases.
*   **[Workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd)**: The open-source Workers runtime itself. Trending among infrastructure geeks who are embedding Workers logic into their own platforms.

## 🧪 Experimental & "Magic"

*   **[Placeholders](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/worker-placeholders)**: A collection of simple, single-file Worker prototypes that do "magic" things like generating SVGs on the fly or handling OG images.
*   **[AI-Agent-Scaffold](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-sdk)**: New SDKs and scaffolds for building autonomous agents that live on the edge, a rapidly growing topic on X.
